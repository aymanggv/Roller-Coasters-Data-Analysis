# 🎢 Roller Coasters — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project analyzes a global database of roller coasters to uncover patterns related to their design, location, and thrill factors like speed, height, and g-force.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: A dataset of roller coasters (`coaster_db.csv`)
- **Included Attributes**:
  - `coaster_name`, `location`, `manufacturer`, `year_introduced`
  - Physical features: `speed_mph`, `height_ft`, `Inversions_clean`, `Gforce_clean`
  - `latitude`, `longitude`, and `Type_Main`

---

## 🔧 EDA Process

### 1. Data Cleaning

- Removed unused or redundant columns.
- Converted `opening_date_clean` to datetime format.
- Handled missing values and cleaned feature names.

### 2. Univariate Analysis

- Examined key roller coaster features:
  - Distribution of speed, height, number of inversions, and g-force.
  - Popular years for new coaster introductions.
  - Common coaster types (`Type_Main`) and manufacturers.

### 3. Bivariate Analysis

- Explored relationships between features:
  - Speed vs. height
  - G-force vs. number of inversions
  - Trends over time: are coasters getting faster or taller?

### 4. Insights by Location

- Identified locations with the fastest roller coasters (filtered for places with at least 10 entries).
- Analyzed geographic trends using latitude and longitude.

## 📈 Visualizations

- Histograms and KDE plots for numeric features.
- Scatter plots for height vs. speed, etc.
- Bar charts for coaster types and manufacturers.
- Time series plots for coaster construction trends.

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- The fastest coasters are often located in major amusement parks in the U.S. and Japan.
- A few manufacturers dominate the roller coaster industry.
- There’s a visible trend toward taller, faster coasters over time.
- More recent coasters tend to offer higher g-forces and more inversions.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Add interactive visualizations with Plotly or Altair
- Build a dashboard summarizing coaster stats by country
- Cluster coasters by thrill factor using unsupervised learning
